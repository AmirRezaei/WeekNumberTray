Project Overview

This project is a lightweight Windows application that displays the current week number in the system tray (also known as the notification area). The primary purpose is to provide a quick and convenient way to keep track of the current week number without having to open a calendar or external app. The application runs in the background and updates the week number dynamically.
Features

    Tray Icon Display: The current week number is always visible in the system tray.
    Dynamic Updates: The week number updates automatically each week, without user intervention.
    Minimal Resource Usage: Designed to use minimal system resources, making it unobtrusive while running in the background.
    Lightweight UI: Right-clicking the tray icon opens a simple settings menu where you can configure display options or exit the app.
    Startup on Boot: Option to have the app automatically start with Windows.


This application is built using:

    C# and .NET: For the core logic of the application.
    Windows Forms: For the tray icon and settings menu.
    System Tray API: To manage the system tray icon and notifications.

Requirements

    .NET 6 or higher
    Windows 10 or later
